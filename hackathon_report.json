                       **Category:** Agenticâ¯AIâ¯+â¯UIâ¯Automation (NovaâAct)  
                       
                       ### Description  
                       - **Frontend:** A lightweight web app (Reactâ¯+â¯Amplify) where students type a âWhat 
                       do I need to learn this week?â prompt.  
                       - **Core Engine:**  
                         1. **Novaâ2âLite** generates a structured weekly syllabus, breaks topics into 
                       biteâsize lessons, and writes short quiz questions.  
                         2. **NovaâAct** orchestrates a multiâstep workflow:  
                            * Pulls freeâopenâsource video / article links from AWSâOpenSearch,  
                            * Populates a personalized Notion/GoogleâDocs template via the respective APIs,  
                            * Sends a reminder email (SES) each evening.  
                       - **Output:** A downloadable PDF + an interactive checklist that updates automatically as 
                       the student marks tasks complete.  
                       
                       ### Why it fits  
                       
                       | Requirement | How itâs met |
                       |-------------|--------------|
                       | **Core tech** | Uses **Novaâ2âLite** for reasoning and **NovaâAct** for agentic 
                       UIâautomation. |
                       | **Scope** | A generative AI app built on AWS (Amplify, Lambda, SES, OpenSearch). |
                       | **Simplicity** | Only two Nova services; the workflow is a linear âplan â fetch 
                       resources â push to docâ. |
                       | **Impact** | Direct community benefit for students & lifelong learners (20â¯% impact 
                       score). |
                       | **Technical depth** | Shows effective prompting, multiâagent orchestration, 
                       integration with external SaaS â strong 60â¯% technical score. |
                       | **Creativity** | Combines AIâgenerated syllabus with automated document creation â a 
                       novel âAIâteacherâassistantâ niche. |

                       ### Description  
                       - **Capture:** Participants join a simple AWSâ¯Chimeâstyle web UI and press 
                       âStartâ. Audio streams to **Novaâ2âSonic** (speechâtoâspeech) in real time.  
                       - **Processing:**  
                         1. **Novaâ2âSonic** converts speech to text, then reâgenerates a concise spoken 
                       summary every 2â¯minutes (so listeners hear a âlive minutesâ overlay).  
                         2. Simultaneously, **Novaâ¯Multimodalâ¯Embeddings** index any shared 
                       slides/screenshots (uploaded via S3) and tag the transcript for âactionâitemâ 
                       detection.  
                       - **Delivery:** At meeting end, a single MP3 of the AIâcrafted summary and a searchable 
                       transcript (with slide thumbnails) are stored in an S3 bucket and emailed to attendees.

                       | Requirement | How itâs met |
                       |-------------|--------------|
                       | **Core tech** | **Novaâ2âSonic** for speechâtoâspeech plus 
                       **Novaâ¯Multimodalâ¯Embeddings** for slide understanding. |
                       | **Scope** | Endâtoâend generative AI on AWS (Transcribeâlite replacement, Lambda, 
                       S3, SES). |
                       | **Simplicity** | One streaming pipeline + one postâprocessing job â no complex 
                       modelâtraining. |
                       | **Impact** | Saves hours of manual noteâtaking for businesses, NGOs, remote teams 
                       (20â¯% impact). |
                       | **Technical depth** | Realâtime streaming, multimodal tagging, and audio synthesis 
                       showcase strong engineering (60â¯%). |
                       | **Creativity** | Live spoken summaries plus visual context linking is a fresh twist on 
                       meetingâAI tools. |

                       ## 3ï¸â£ Idea: **SnapâShop Assistant â Visual Product Search & Checkout Bot**  
                       **Category:** Multimodalâ¯Understandingâ¯+â¯UIâ¯Automation (NovaâAct)  
                       
                       ### Description  
                       - **User Flow:** On a mobile web page, a shopper snaps a photo of an item they own (e.g., 
                       a lamp).  
                       - **Engine:**  
                         1. **Novaâ¯Multimodalâ¯Embeddings** encode the photo and compare it against a catalog 
                       of product images stored in a Pineconeâstyle vector DB on Amazonâ¯OpenSearch.  
                         2. The topâ5 matching products (title, price, rating) are shown instantly.  
                         3. If the user clicks âBuyâ, **NovaâAct** drives a headless Chromium session (via 
                       AWSâ¯Lambdaâ¯Container) that logs into the chosen eâcommerce site, adds the item to 
                       cart, and completes checkout using the userâs saved payment token (PCIâcompliant via 
                       AWSâ¯Paymentâ¯Cryptography).  
                       - **Result:** Oneâclick purchase of visuallyâmatched items without manual search.  
                       
                       ### Why it fits  
                       
                       | Requirement | How itâs met |
                       |-------------|--------------|
                       | **Core tech** | Leverages **Novaâ¯Multimodalâ¯Embeddings** for image similarity and 
                       **NovaâAct** for automated UI checkout. |
                       | **Scope** | Full generative AIâenhanced shopping assistant hosted on AWS (S3, Lambda, 
                       OpenSearch, DynamoDB). |
                       | **Simplicity** | Two main components (imageâsearch + checkout bot) keep the 
                       architecture straightforward. |
                       | **Impact** | Boosts accessibility for visuallyâimpaired shoppers and streamlines 
                       âphotoâtoâbuyâ for any retailer (20â¯% impact). |
                       | **Technical depth** | Shows highâquality multimodal retrieval and secure agentic 
                       automation â strong technical scoring. |
                       | **Creativity** | Combines visual search with a fully automated purchase flow, a 
                       useâcase rarely seen in hackathons. |

                       All three concepts satisfy the **mandatory Nova usage**, are **AWSânative**, and balance 
                       **creativity**, **simplicity**, and **validity** to maximise the judging scores. Good 
                       luck! ð}
