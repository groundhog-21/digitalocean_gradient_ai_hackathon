                       AI writes code. That's expected now. The real opportunity? Everything else.
                       
                       Planning. Security. Compliance. Deployments. These are the bottlenecks that slow teams 
                       down every day. And they're wide open for automation.
                       
                       We're opening up the GitLab Duo Agent Platform and inviting developers worldwide to build 
                       AI agents that help you and your team to build secure software faster. Not chatbots that 
                       answer questions. Agents that jump into workflows, respond to events, and take action on 
                       your behalf.
                       
                       Think of it as building a digital teammate for every developer using GitLab.
                       
                       Why Join?
                       Be early: Get access to the GitLab Duo Agent Platform for the duration of the hackathon 
                       while it's fresh! Learn it. Build on it. Shape it.
                       Learn how to build agents that assist you with tedious tasks such as creating tests
                       Learn how to build a flow of agents and orchestrate an entire team of purpose-built agents 
                       to build & deploy feature requests from creating, testing, security scanning to deployment.
                       Make an impact: Your agent could ship to thousands of GitLab users. This isn't just a side 
                       project that sits in a repo.

                       What to Build
                       Anything that removes friction from the software development lifecycle. Automate security 
                       fixes. Streamline code reviews. Generate compliance reports. Flag risks before they become 
                       problems.
                       
                       The best submissions will tell a story: here's the pain, here's how the agent solves it, 
                       here's what changes for developers.
                       
                       Chat alone won't qualify. We want to see agents that react to triggers and take action.
                       
                       At least one custom public agent or public flow should be created. See the resources tab 
                       to learn how to create custom agents & flows, and get inspired in what is possible to 
                       build.

                       - *Integration with partner platforms* (Google Cloud, Anthropic) carries a sizable 
                       monetary incentive, indicating a strong weighting for those who can demonstrate real 
                       usage.  
                       - *Usability* (Easiest to Use) and *sustainability* (Green Agent, Sustainable Design) are 
                       also explicitly rewarded but with smaller cash values.

                       **Description**  
                       A GitLab Duoâ¯Agent that fires **when a Merge Request (MR) is opened or updated**.  
                       1. The agent pulls the diff, runs a fast staticâanalysis check 
                       (e.g.,â¯`gitlabâcodeâquality` orâ¯`ESLint`).  
                       2. It sends the diff plus the analysis results to an **Anthropic LLM** (via the Anthropic 
                       API) and asks the model to:  
                          * Summarise the change inâ¯â¤â¯2â¯sentences,  
                          * Highlight any risky patterns,  
                          * Propose concrete codeâfix suggestions (e.g., missing `await`, insecure string 
                       concatenation).  
                       3. The agent posts a **structured comment** on the MR containing the summary, risk flags, 
                       and the suggested patches (as `suggestion` blocks).  
                       4. If the developer approves the suggestion through a quick âð Applyâ reaction, the 
                       agent automatically creates a **new branch**, applies the patch, and opens a **followâup 
                       MR** with the fix.  
                       
                       **Why it fits**  
                       | Criterion | How the idea satisfies it |
                       |-----------|---------------------------|
                       | **Mustâbuild #1** â public agent/flow | The agent source lives in a **public GitLab 
                       project** under the âGitLabâ¯AIâ¯Hackathonâ group; the repo is linked in the 
                       submission. |
                       | **Mustâbuild #2** â act, not just chat | The agent **reacts to MRâopened/updated 
                       events** and **creates actionable suggestions/patches**. |
                       | **Mustâbuild #3** â solve a friction point | Codeâreview bottlenecks are a major 
                       pain point; the agent delivers a firstâpass review and autoâfixes lowârisk issues, 
                       accelerating the review cycle. |
                       | **Openâsource repo** | All code, a `LICENSE` (MIT), and a README with install/run 
                       steps are committed publicly. |
                       | **Demo video â¤â¯3â¯min** | A short walkthrough shows an MR being opened, the AI 
                       comment appearing, the âApplyâ reaction, and the autoâgenerated fix MR. |
                       | **Technical depth** (Grand / TechâImpressive) | Uses GitLab Duo Agent SDK, integrates 
                       **Anthropic LLMs**, parses diff, generates patch suggestions, and automates branch 
                       creation â a nonâtrivial pipeline. |
                       | **Impact** (Most Impactful) | Cuts review turnaround from hours to minutes for routine 
                       changes, measurable by âtimeâtoâfirstâreview.â |
                       | **Usability** (Easiest to Use) | Installation is a oneâline `gitlab-runner` 
                       registration; the agent is enabled via a single projectâlevel variable; no extra UI 
                       needed. |
                       | **Partner prize** â Anthropic | Direct Anthropic LLM usage positions the project for 
                       the âMost Impactful on GitLabâ¯&â¯Anthropicâ track. |
                       | **Sustainability** | Runs only on MR events, negligible compute waste â a good 
                       candidate for the **Green Agent** bonus. |

                       **Description**  
                       A triggerâdriven Duoâ¯Agent that watches **pipeline completion events**. When a 
                       pipeline finishes with a **SAST (Static Application Security Testing) failure**, the 
                       agent:  
                       
                       1. Extracts the vulnerability details from the SAST report.  
                       2. Calls an **Anthropic (or Gemini on GCP) LLM** to generate a **minimal, safe code fix** 
                       for the reported issue.  
                       3. Opens a **new branch** named `fix/vulnâ<id>`, applies the patch, and creates a 
                       **Merge Request** titled âAutoâremediateâ¯<CVEâid>â.  
                       4. Adds a comment linking the original SAST finding to the new MR, so security owners can 
                       review/approve.  
                       
                       Optionally, the agent can push the MR to a **Google Cloud CloudâBuild** job that runs a 
                       quick regression test before flagging the MR as âready for reviewâ.  
                       
                       **Why it fits**  
                       | Criterion | How the idea satisfies it |
                       |-----------|---------------------------|
                       | **Public agent/flow** | Hosted in a **public GitLab project** under the hackathon group. 
                       |
                       | **Acts on events** | Triggered by **pipelineâfinished** events with SAST failures; it 
                       **creates branches and MRs** â not a chatâonly bot. |
                       | **Frictionâpoint solved** | Automates the tedious âmanual fixâ¯+â¯new MRâ loop 
                       after security scans, dramatically reducing TimeâtoâRemediation. |
                       | **Openâsource & license** | Repository includes an `Apacheâ2.0` LICENSE and full 
                       documentation. |
                       | **Demo â¤â¯3â¯min** | Video shows a pipeline failing, the agent spawning a fix MR, 
                       and the security team approving it. |
                       | **Technical depth** | Leverages the **GitLab Duo Agent API**, parses SAST JSON, 
                       integrates with an LLM, manipulates git objects, and optionally triggers GCP CloudâBuild 
                       â strong engineering showcase. |
                       | **Impact** | Directly improves security posture; can be measured by âaverage days to 
                       fix a vulnerability.â |
                       | **Usability** | Once the agent is enabled, no developer action is needed; the flow is 
                       fully automatic. |
                       | **Partner prizes** â Google Cloud & Anthropic | Optional use of **Google Cloud Build** 
                       for testing earns the âMost Impactful on GitLabâ¯&â¯Googleâ track; LLM usage 
                       satisfies the Anthropic track as well. |
                       | **Green Agent** | Runs only on failed pipelines, shortâlived compute; qualifies for 
                       sustainability bonuses. |

                       **Ideaâ¯3 â âComplianceâSnapshot Generatorâ**  
                       
                       **Description**  
                       A Duoâ¯Agent that triggers **when a Git tag (release) is created**. It performs the 
                       following steps:  
                       
                       1. Collects the **commit list**, **pipeline status**, and **glossary of open issues** 
                       associated with the tag.  
                       2. Sends the collected metadata to **Google Cloud Document AI** (or an Anthropic LLM) to 
                       **draft a compliance report** (e.g., SOCâ¯2, GDPR checklist).  
                       3. Stores the generated PDF in a **public Google Cloud Storage bucket** (or GitLab package 
                       registry).  
                       4. Posts a comment on the **release MR** (or the tag page) with a link to the PDF and a 
                       short summary.  
                       
                       The agent also writes a `compliance.json` artifact to the repo for downstream consumption 
                       (e.g., automated audit pipelines).  
                       
                       **Why it fits**  
                       | Criterion | How the idea satisfies it |
                       |-----------|---------------------------|
                       | **Public agent/flow** | Implemented as a public GitLab Duo Agent in a public repo. |
                       | **Triggerâdriven** | Fires on **tagâcreated** events; it **creates artifacts and 
                       comments** â no chatâonly behavior. |
                       | **Addresses friction** | Automates the manual, errorâprone task of assembling 
                       compliance documentation for each release. |
                       | **Openâsource repo** | Contains full source, a `MIT` license, and stepâbyâstep 
                       README. |
                       | **Demo video** | Shows a developer creating a tag, the agent generating a PDF, and the
